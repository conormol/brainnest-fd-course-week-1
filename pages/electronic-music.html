                        The highly publicized 'death of disco' in 1979 prompted a musical response in artists looking to push the envelope of what dance and club music could be. Artists that had survived Disco's demise began to incorprate synthesizers and drum machines into their writing and performing process in order to scale down the previously expensive and highly polished production quality of Disco. Notable artists include Kool & The Gang, Earth, Wind and Fire, and Gwen Guthrie.

                        Taking inspiration from DJ culture in the UK and Caribbean, as well as the hip hop DJs rising to fame on America's East Coast, Post Disco began to morph into house through Nightclubs like Chicago's 'Warehouse' and New York's 'Paradise Garage'. Pioneering DJs in the House Music revolution were Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles.

                        Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, the United Kingdom put its own spin on the music that was emerging from Europe, the United States, and other music trends such as sound system culture in the Caribbean. This led to a wave of reactionary subgenres in the UK such as UK Garage, Drum'n'Bass, Jungle, Grime and Dubstep.
